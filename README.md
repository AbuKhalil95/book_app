# Google API Book App
This week, you and your partner(s) will implement a basic full-stack application for a book list which will include the ability to search the Google Books API, add books to a database, and then render those books from a PostgreSQL database. You will also add the ability to update the details of a book or remove it from the collection.

Todayâ€™s portion of the application involves requesting books from the API. The client can submit a form to search for a book by title or author, and the search results will then be rendered as a list in the browser.
